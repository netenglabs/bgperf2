# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.


## rules

commit-message:
  max-length: 144
  format: conventional
  no-body: false

code-review:
  before-commit: required

**Run `/code-review` on the staged/working diff before every `git commit`**, and act on what it
finds before committing — fix it, or say plainly why you are committing anyway. Skip only for
commits that change no code at all (docs-only, or moving files without editing them).

This is not ceremony. There is no CI on this repo and the test suite deliberately cannot touch
Docker, so it covers the pure layers only — a real `bench` is the sole end-to-end check and nobody
runs one per commit. Review is the only thing standing between a bad edit and master.

git:
  never-cd: required

**Never `cd` into a directory to run git — use `git -C <dir> ...`.** It works from any cwd, leaves
the shell's working directory alone, and matches the permission rules already allowed here, so it
does not trigger a fresh approval prompt for every command. This applies to *any* repo, including
scratch clones outside the project. A `PreToolUse` hook in `.claude/settings.json` denies
`cd ... && git ...`, so the shortcut will simply fail rather than prompt.

## What this is

bgperf2 benchmarks BGP daemons by running them in Docker containers, blasting routes at them from
generator containers, and measuring how long they take to converge plus their CPU/memory cost. Forked
from osrg/bgperf with significant changes.

## Setup and commands

```bash
source venv/bin/activate          # or prefix commands with venv/bin/python
pip install -r pip-requirements.txt

./bgperf2.py doctor               # verify docker version + which bgperf/* images exist
./bgperf2.py images               # which daemon versions are built, and from which git ref
./bgperf2.py verify               # start each built image, check it reports its own version
./bgperf2.py verify -t frr_c      # just one daemon
./bgperf2.py prepare              # build all daemon images (slow; compiles from source)
./bgperf2.py prepare -t frr_c --versions 10.4,10.5   # just these, for one daemon
./bgperf2.py update <image> --version 10.7           # add one version image
./bgperf2.py dockerfile frr_c --version 8.0          # print a recipe without building it
./bgperf2.py bench -t bird -n 10 -p 1000    # one run: 10 peers x 1000 prefixes
./bgperf2.py bench -t frr_c --version 10.1  # a specific release
./bgperf2.py batch -c bench.yaml  # matrix of runs -> CSV + PNG graphs
./bgperf2.py config -o out.yml    # emit scenario.yaml without running
```

Requires Docker (user must be in the `docker` group), and `sysstat` for `mpstat` — `bench` shells out
to `mpstat` and `free`, and will crash without them.

```bash
venv/bin/pip install -r test-requirements.txt
venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q        # ~0.5s, no Docker needed
venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_convergence.py -q
```

The test suite deliberately needs **no Docker daemon and no privileges** — it covers the pure layers
(stats row/header contract, convergence rules, CLI-output parsers, module imports). Importing
`bgperf2` works without a reachable daemon, which is what makes that possible; keep it that way.
There is no coverage of the container orchestration itself, so a real `bench` is still the only
end-to-end check. Use `-n1 -p1` for the fastest one.

The venv is tied to a specific interpreter — a distro Python upgrade orphans it. Recreate with
`rm -rf venv && python3 -m venv venv && venv/bin/pip install -r pip-requirements.txt`.

## Architecture

### The three roles

Every `bench` run creates containers on a dedicated Docker bridge network (`<bench-name>-br`):

- **target** — the daemon under test. One per run.
- **monitor** — always a GoBGP instance peered with the target. It is the *measurement instrument*:
  `bench` polls `gobgp neighbor -j` once a second and reads `afi_safis[0].state.accepted` to see how
  many routes the target has re-advertised. This is what "recved" means in the output.
- **testers** — one or more route generators peered with the target. BIRD (default) or ExaBGP for
  synthetic prefixes; GoBGP, ExaBGP-mrtparse, or bgpdump2 for MRT file playback.

Routes flow tester → target → monitor. Timing is measured at the monitor, so it captures full
propagation, not just reception.

### Config generation flow

`gen_conf()` builds a `scenario.yaml` describing AS numbers, addresses, router IDs, per-neighbor
prefix lists, and monitor `check-points`. It is **Mako-templated** — `gen_mako_macro()` injects a
`gen_paths(n)` helper so the file stays small for large prefix counts. `bench` renders it with Mako,
then parses it as YAML. `-f` passes a hand-written scenario instead.

Each container class then translates that scenario into its own native config format and writes it
to a host directory bind-mounted into the container (`/tmp/<bench-name>/<role>/`). Startup is
uniform: `exec_startup_cmd()` writes a `start.sh` into that directory and execs it inside the
container. To debug a target that won't come up, run its `start.sh` by hand and read the output:

```bash
docker exec bgperf_bird_target /root/config/start.sh
```

### Class hierarchy

`base.py` defines `Container` → `Target` and `Tester`. Each daemon module contributes a *base* class
(holding `GUEST_DIR`, the `dockerfile` string, and a `build_image` classmethod with a default
`bgperf/<name>` tag) plus a *target* class that mixes it with `Target`:

```
class BIRDTarget(BIRD, Target)          # bird.py
class FRRoutingCompiledTarget(FRRoutingCompiled, FRRoutingTarget)
class RustyBGPTarget(RustyBGP, GoBGPTarget)   # reuses GoBGP's config writer
```

MRO order matters — the daemon base comes first so its `GUEST_DIR`/`dockerfile` win. Testers use the
same trick (`class Bgpdump2Tester(Tester, Bgpdump2, MRTTester)`).

**To add a daemon target**, implement: `build_image` (the Dockerfile lives inline as a class
attribute), `write_config`, `get_startup_cmd`, `get_version_cmd`, and `get_neighbors_state`, and set
`IMAGE_REPO`. Then register it in two dicts at the top of `bgperf2.py` — `TARGET_CLASSES` (which
feeds the `-t` choices, `bench()`'s dispatch, and `remove_target_containers()`) and
`BUILDABLE_IMAGES`/`PREPARE_IMAGES` if it builds from source.

`build_image` should take `(force, tag, checkout, nocache, version)` and default `tag` to
`cls.image_tag()`, so `build_version()` can drive it.

### Versions

Multi-version testing lives in `Container` (`base.py`). Each daemon declares `IMAGE_REPO`,
optionally `VERSIONS` (what `prepare` builds), `DEFAULT_REF`, and overrides `resolve_ref()` to map a
user-facing version onto that project's ref naming — FRR `10.1` → `stable/10.1`, BIRD `2.19.2` →
`v2.19.2`. Images are `<IMAGE_REPO>:<sanitized version>`, or `:latest` when no version is given.

`img_exists()` is tag-aware. It used to compare only the repository half of `RepoTags[0]`, which is
why the old FRR builds faked version tags with path-like names (`bgperf/frr_c/stable_8`) — those
still work if passed explicitly as `image:`, but nothing builds them any more.

Different versions can need different *build instructions*, not just a different checkout, so the
inline Dockerfiles are format strings over `BUILD_VARS` (`{ubuntu_version}`, `{extra_setup}`,
`{configure_extra}`, `{ref}`), and `VERSION_BUILD_VARS` overrides those per version prefix. A
literal brace in one of those recipes has to be doubled. When a version needs a wholly different
recipe, `dockerfiles/<name>/<version>.dockerfile` replaces the inline one and receives `BGPERF_REF`
/ `BGPERF_VERSION` as docker build args.

`./bgperf2.py images` lists versions and their refs; `./bgperf2.py dockerfile <name> --version X`
renders a recipe without building it (`Container.render_dockerfile`, which short-circuits
`build_dockerfile` via `_RenderOnly`). `doctor` reports built vs not-built versions per daemon.

A bare `prepare` builds only the unversioned images; version lists are opt-in behind `-t`, since
`FRRoutingCompiled.VERSIONS` alone is four full compiles. It prints its plan and skips what exists.

`--threads N` sets worker threads on the target (`conf['target']['threads']`). Only BIRD reads it
so far: **BIRD 3 runs one worker unless the config says otherwise**, so benching 3.x against 2.x
without it measures nothing (verified: 3.3.2 gives 2 OS threads by default, 5 with `threads 4`;
2.19.2 accepts the keyword and stays at 1).

`bench()` and `batch()` resolve and verify images before starting any container, so a version that
was never built costs a second rather than an hour.

Batch configs take `versions: [...]` on a target, expanded by `expand_target_versions()` into one
run per version with an auto label. Batch yaml is parsed with `BatchLoader`, which drops YAML's
float resolver — plain `yaml.safe_load` reads `10.10` as `10.1` and would silently bench the wrong
release.

### get_neighbors_state — the per-daemon wart

`bench` needs to know how many prefixes each neighbor has sent, and every daemon reports this
differently. There is no common API, so each target parses its own CLI:

- FRR: `vtysh -c 'sh ip bgp summary json'`, JSON
- BIRD: `birdc 'show protocols all'` parsed with a **TextFSM template** (`bird.tfsm`)
- Junos/EOS/SR Linux: vendor JSON via their own CLIs

FRR is a special case worth knowing about: it has no received-prefix counter, so
`FRRoutingTarget.get_neighbor_received_routes()` overrides the base method and greps `bgpd.log` for
`End-of-RIB` messages instead.

### Recording versions — provenance

A result nobody can trace back to a build is not reproducible, so every run records the version
**and** image of all three roles, not just the target: the testers generate the load and the monitor
is the instrument the timings are read from.

- `Container.version_string()` is the only thing that should ever be called for this. It returns
  what the daemon reported, or a string starting `UNKNOWN` explaining why not — it never guesses.
  Commas are rewritten to `;` because rows are `','.join()`ed with no quoting.
- Each daemon's `get_version_cmd`/`exec_version_cmd` belong on the **daemon base class**
  (`BIRD`, `GoBGP`, `RustyBGP`), not the `*Target` subclass. `Monitor(GoBGP)` and
  `BIRDTester(Tester, BIRD)` inherit from the base, so a version command defined on the target was
  invisible to them and asking raised `NotImplementedError`. That is why only targets used to be
  recorded.
- Parse defensively. These parsers used to take a fixed word (`ret.split(' ')[2]`), which on an
  error message produced a plausible-looking value — `benchmarks/baseline/baseline-benchmark.csv`
  has two rows whose BIRD version is the word `exec`. Match the expected banner and raise
  `VersionUnavailable` otherwise.
- `collect_provenance()` asks one tester per distinct image and records a count, so a 100-peer run
  does not exec into 100 containers.
- Output goes two places: three columns appended to the **end** of the stats row (`target image`,
  `tester version`, `monitor version`) and a full `<prefix>.versions.json` manifest beside the
  graphs. Appending at the end is required — `create_batch_graphs()` indexes the row positionally.

Caveat worth knowing: a git ref pins source, not dependencies. RustyBGP gitignores its `Cargo.lock`,
so its builds resolve dependencies fresh and old refs rot — `340f521` (the 2024-12 commit the 2025
baseline benched) no longer compiles on any toolchain, which is why it is not offered as a version.

### verify — the check the test suite cannot do

`./bgperf2.py verify` starts a throwaway container per built image and asks the daemon about
itself. It exists because the unit tests deliberately cannot touch Docker, so nothing else covers
the seam where a parser meets a real container — and that is exactly where the bugs have been.
Both of these pass every unit test and are caught by `verify` in about a second per image:

- rustybgp read its version with **GoBGP's** parser (`RustyBGPTarget`'s MRO is
  `RustyBGP → GoBGPTarget → GoBGP`), recording `UNKNOWN` on every run.
- openbgpd looked for `bgpctl` under `/usr/local/sbin`, which does not exist in the image.

It also checks the daemon binary for gcov instrumentation, the defect that made every FRR result
incomparable for years. Notes for anyone extending it:

- Probe through the classes that really run the image — `TARGET_CLASSES` **and** `TESTER_CLASSES`,
  never the daemon base class. The rustybgp bug was invisible when the base was asked directly,
  because GoBGP is not in that MRO. `TESTER_CLASSES` exists for this: `bench` builds
  `ExaBGPTester(Tester, ExaBGP)`, not `ExaBGP`, and bird/gobgp run as both roles with different MROs.
- The throwaway container is created with `entrypoint=[]`. `command` is *appended* to an
  `ENTRYPOINT`, not run instead of it, so `bgperf/bgpdump2` and `bgperf/exabgp_mrtparse`
  (`ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash"]`) would run `bash sleep 600`, exit 126, and every later `exec` would
  fail with "not running" — while `dckr.start()` still returned success.
- The tag-vs-reported-version check runs only when the label could plausibly appear in a banner
  (`expect_version_in_banner`). `resolve_ref()` passes unrecognized values through as raw refs, so
  `update gobgp --version master` is supported and reports `3.38.0` — demanding the word "master"
  would fail a good image. Matching is anchored on a numeric boundary, because a bare substring
  makes `3.1` match `3.13`.
- An explicitly requested version that is missing, or a run that checked nothing at all, exits
  non-zero. A green result over zero checks is the one outcome a caller must not be able to trust.
- `VERSION_NEEDS_DAEMON` (FRR) means the version command talks to a running daemon over a socket,
  so a bare container cannot answer it — it is reported as unprobeable, not as broken.
- A daemon with no version command at all is a declared gap, not a failure; failing on it would
  make `verify` permanently red and therefore worthless.
- The gcov pattern is `GCOV_PATTERN`, and `.gcda` only counts where a **non-letter** follows.
  A bare `\.gcda` matches Go's `runtime.gcdata` and flags every gobgp image. Both halves were
  validated against a purpose-built instrumented/clean pair — a detector that never fires is worse
  than none.
- `verify` creates containers, so it is not in the permission allowlist alongside the read-only
  subcommands.

### Termination detection

Lives in `convergence.py` as `ConvergenceTracker`, deliberately separated from `bench()`'s container
plumbing so the rules are testable without Docker (`tests/test_convergence.py`).

The naive check ("stop when received == expected") only works for synthetic prefix generation. With
MRT playback the total unique prefix count is unknown (peers' tables overlap), and with filtering
enabled the accepted count is deliberately lower than what was sent. So the tracker instead waits for
the count to go *stable*: `ASSURANCE_SAMPLES` (20) without change, or 5 if the configured checkpoint
was already hit. Those trailing samples are subtracted from the reported elapsed time afterward.

It also detects failure: a count that stops moving for `STUCK_SAMPLES` (600), a drop of >1% sustained
over 10 samples, or nothing arriving at all within 15s. `bench()` feeds it one sample per monitor
poll via `update()` and acts on the returned status; `note_neighbors_checkpoint()` is called from the
target branch when every neighbor has finished sending.

## Targets and images

Open-source daemons are built from source into `bgperf/<name>` images by `prepare`/`update`.

FRR is only ever `frr_c` — compiled from a git checkout, with `prepare` building master plus the
releases in `FRRoutingCompiled.VERSIONS`.

**If your `bgperf/frr_c:*` images predate 2026-08-08, rebuild them: `prepare -f -t frr_c`.** They
were compiled with `--enable-gcov`, which links gcov coverage instrumentation into `bgpd` itself, so
those images benchmark an instrumented binary against everyone else's optimized one. Measured on FRR
10.7.0, same source, 4 peers × 25k prefixes: **103% CPU instrumented vs 45% clean**, and ~12% more
memory. Convergence time was unchanged at that size — the run is not CPU-bound there — so the
distortion sits in the CPU and memory columns, which is exactly where it is hardest to notice.
`prepare` skips any tag that already exists, so nothing invalidates these automatically; a batch
mixing a freshly built version with a cached one silently compares the two kinds of binary.

The old `frr` target (a wrapper over the prebuilt `frrouting/frr:v7.5.1` image) was removed. **`frr.py` still exists and must stay**: its
`FRRoutingTarget` holds all the FRR config generation, `get_neighbors_state`, and End-of-RIB parsing,
which `FRRoutingCompiledTarget` inherits. Only the image build and CLI target went away.

OpenBGPD is the one open-source target that is **repackaged rather than compiled**: the image is
`FROM openbgpd/openbgpd:<tag>`, so a "version" is an upstream Docker tag (7.3 through 9.2 exist) and
the inherited passthrough `resolve_ref()` is already correct. Two consequences that do not apply to
the compiled daemons:

- The upstream image starts the daemon itself — its entrypoint is `multirun bgpd bgplgd haproxy` on
  the image's own `/etc/bgpd.conf`. bgperf's `start.sh` then died with `cannot bind to
  0.0.0.0:179: Address in use`, the target never peered, and the run hung in "Waiting N seconds for
  monitor" forever. The recipe sets `ENTRYPOINT []` so the container idles like every other image
  and `exec_startup_cmd()` is what starts bgpd, on the config under test.
- `PULL_BASE = True`, because here the base image *is* the daemon. Docker does not re-pull a `FROM`
  it already has, so a locally cached `openbgpd/openbgpd:latest` kept `bgperf/openbgp:latest` at 8.8
  long after 9.2 shipped — a run recording a version nobody asked for, with nothing looking wrong.
  It is off for everyone else, where the base image is only a toolchain.

  Read it through `Container.pulls_base(tag)`, never the flag directly. It applies to the
  **unversioned tag only**: `FROM openbgpd/openbgpd:9.2` is immutable so a pull can find nothing
  new, and `pull` is *fatal* when the registry is unreachable even though the image is already
  local — which would turn an offline `prepare -t openbgp` into a failure it never used to be.
  `prepare` also rebuilds such a tag unconditionally, since "already built" says nothing about
  whether it is current, and passes `force` to match — `build_dockerfile()` skips an existing tag
  otherwise, so it would be planned and then quietly not built.

Note that `batch()` assigns `args.target` straight from the yaml, so it bypasses argparse's `choices`
validation — `tests/test_static.py` checks the benchmark configs instead.

Commercial NOSes (Junos cRPD, Arista cEOS, SR Linux) are never built. Download them out of band and
tag them as `crpd:latest` / `ceos:latest` — or as `crpd:<version>` to select them with `--version`
like any other daemon. These write root-owned files into `/tmp/bgperf2`, which bgperf2 then cannot
clean up; `sudo rm -rf /tmp/bgperf2` when that happens. Their licenses prohibit publishing results.

## Conventions

- Container names are fixed strings (`bgperf_<name>_target`, `bgperf_monitor`) declared as
  `CONTAINER_NAME` class attributes; testers use a `CONTAINER_NAME_PREFIX` plus an index.
- Policy/filter fragments live in `filters/*.conf` and are read verbatim at config-write time.
  `nos_templates/*.j2` are Jinja2 templates for the commercial NOSes (rendered via
  `Target.get_template`). Note the two template engines coexist: Mako for scenarios, Jinja2 for NOS
  configs.
- Stats flow through a single `queue.Queue` fed by daemon threads (one per container plus two for
  host-level CPU/memory). Consumers dispatch on the `who` key.
- `batch()` runs `bench()` in-process by synthesizing an `argparse.Namespace` per cell of the matrix,
  so any new `bench` argument must also be added to the field lists in `batch()` or it will be
  missing at runtime.
- Graph column indices in `create_batch_graphs()` are positional into the stats row built by
  `create_output_stats()`, and `stats_header()` names those columns by position too. All three must
  agree; `tests/test_stats_contract.py` enforces it. They drifted once already, silently shifting
  every batch CSV by one column.
- Resource files are resolved from `REPO_ROOT` (defined in `base.py`), not the working directory, so
  bgperf2 can run from anywhere. Generated output goes to `--results-dir` (default `results/`).
